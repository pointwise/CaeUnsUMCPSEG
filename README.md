## Building the UMCPSEG Plugin

To build the University of Michigan Computational Plasma Science and Engineering 
Group (UMCPSEG) plugin you must integrate the source code from this repository 
into your local PluginSDK installation.

This plugin was created with the `mkplugin` options `-cpp` and `-caeu`.

See [How To Integrate Plugin Code][HowTo] for details.
